        This is truly one of the easiest recipes ever. The cast iron skillet stove top method works for a variety of pork chops – boneless or bone in, loin or shoulder, rib or sirloin. You can serve them straight out of the skillet with their own tasty herb infused melted butter and olive oil goodness or whip up a quick pan sauce to drizzle over them.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pork chops. We used thick cut Frenched. Frenched is really just a fancy way to describe a technique in which the pork chop’s rib bone is exposed after the meat is removed from around it</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Cooking oil and butter. Butter for flavor and oil so that the butter doesn’t burn</li>
      <li>Herbs and garlic cloves. To flavor the butter and cooking oil we like the combination of thyme and rosemary with a few garlic cloves. Sage or oregano work great too. At the end you can garnish with more fresh herbs </li>
      <strong>By the way of equipment all you need is a good, heavy cast iron skillet and your stove</strong>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li>QUICK BRINE:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
          Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup salt in 1 quart hot water.
          Let cool down completely (a trick you can use is bring only half the water to boil, dissolve the sugar and salt, then add the other half of the needed water by way of ice cubes).
          Place the pork chops in the brine solution. Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2 hours and up to 6-8.
          When ready to cook first pat dry the pork chops with a paper towel

          </ul>

        <li>To cook pork chops on the stove all you need to do is:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
          for thicker cuts season with salt and pepper on each side heat the skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter, olive oil, garlic and herbs, stir around and let get fragrant sear the pork chops (you can use a spoon to gently baste with the butter and oil mixture). Do not futz with the stove temperature – keep it at medium-high:) cover loosely with foil and let rest for about 5 minutes If you are cooking more chops than can fit in your skillet do two batches and add more butter, olive oil etc for the second batch

          </ul>

        <li>  HOW LONG TO COOK THICK PORK CHOPS ON STOVE</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
          You need to cook the pork chops until they brown nicely on each side, flipping only once, until their internal temperature reaches 155 F for medium. We feel this is a good temperature for brined chops. If you prefer to cook them slightly underdone, 145 F is the medium-rare yet food safe temperature for pork chops. Use a food thermometer (affiliate link) to take the temperature and measure in the center of each chop. The exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of the pork chops, how many you have in the skillet at the same time, the size of your skillet and your stove top’s burner type (gas or electric, size etc). Generally, if you have thinner chops (around 1/2 inch) cook each side for 3 minutes. Cook thick pork chops (around 3/4 to 1 inch or slightly thicker) for 5-7 minutes per side.
